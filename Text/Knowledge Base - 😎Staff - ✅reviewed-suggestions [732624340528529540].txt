Not to be mean, but I see these messages a dozen a dime.

I don't know if you're an actual person or just a bot, but I've dealt with many of these messages and they may as well be spam and rumors/lies that uses unknowing people to spread.

__None of these are real__, accepting a friend request doesn't reveal any more information than there already is
